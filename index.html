                                <p style="color: #86858b; line-height: 1.6;">once you've subscribed you'll be invited to a private trello board where you can make your first design request by adding a card to the 'active request' column. you can even do this on the first day. after a couple days of submitting your design request you will have something (magical) to look at. and don't worry, if it's not perfect, we'll revise it as many times as you like until it is. all good? move onto the next request.</p>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">How it works</span><br/>
                    Shortly after you subscribe you'll be invited to a private trello
                    board where you can make your first design request. A few days
                    later you'll have a design in hand. And don't worry, if it's not 
                    perfect, we'll revise it until it is. Once you've approved, we'll
                    move on to the next request.
                    <br/><br/><br/>
                    
                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">Why wouldn't I just hire a full-time designer?</span><br/>
                    Hiring a full-time designer not only requires a large time investment
                    but also a financial one. The average designer's salary can start
                    around $200k.<br>
                    <p style="text-indent: 32pt;">
                        with mid™️ you and your team get instant access to an experienced designer, allowing
                        your team to make progress as quickly as the first week you subscribe.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 32pt;">
                        even better, you can simply pause your subscription at any time if your
                        design needs slow down. you can't do that with a full-time designer.
                    </p>
                    <br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?</span><br/>
                   You and your team can add as many requests as you'd like to the queue. Based on
                   your prioritization they will be designed and delivered one by one.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">How fast will I receive my designs?</span><br/>
                    On average, for most requests you'll receive a first draft in just three days or less. However, 
                    more complex requests can take longer — but don't worry we'll let you know if that's the case.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">How do I manage my subscription?</span><br/>
                    Your trello board will have a link to your customer login where you can pause or cancel your subscription.
                    <p style="text-indent: 32pt;">
                        If your design need dries up, simply pause and you can come back whenever to use the rest 
                        of the month you've already paid for.
                    </p>
                    <br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">What design software do you use?</span><br/>
                    We use Figma.<br/><br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">How do I request designs?</span><br/>
                    simply move a trello card with all the details of your request into the 'active request' column. 
                    feel free to attach a google doc, wireframes, sketches, or even recording a quick Loom video. 
                    we'll comment if there is any clarification needed and then we'll jump into the work. 
                    <br/><br/><br/>

                    <span style="color: #CFCFCF; line-height: 2.5;">Are there any refunds if I don't like the service?</span><br/>
                    Sadly, no.
                    <p style="text-indent: 32pt;">
